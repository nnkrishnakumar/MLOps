# MLOps

2. The stages of MLOps:
-----------------------
    i.  Data Collection and Preparations : 
        > Data ingestion, Preparation , exploration.
        > Define Goal & identify data source,
        > Prepare, Label and explore raw data.
        > Convert raw data to features.

    ii. Model Development and Training:
        > Getting data ready for ML Model.
        > Perform model training and validation.
        > Evaluation of ML Models.

            Here ml pipeline comes in picture:
                ML pipeline is cruicial
                Modularization and versioned(git repository)
                Automation Pipeline

            Here we will learn various tools like:
                1> github
                2> mlflow
                3> jenkins
                4> cloud resources
                5> Cloud computing
                6> Grafana
                7> Chromithius
                8> Contanerization platform

    Once the model Development is complete then proced with 

    iii> ML service deployment:

        1> Integrate with existing application
        2> Create Front end
        3> Containerize the application
        4> API services
        5> Model endpoint

    iv> Continuous Feedback Monitoring:
        1> Track data & Infrastructure
        2> Model
        3> Application Metrics
