# MLOps

2. The stages of MLOps:
-----------------------
    i.  Data Collection and Preparations : 
        > Data ingestion, Preparation , exploration.
        > Define Goal & identify data source,
        > Prepare, Label and explore raw data.
        > Convert raw data to features.

    ii. Model Development and Training:
        > Getting data ready for ML Model.
        > Perform model training and validation.
        > Evaluation of ML Models.

            Here ml pipeline comes in picture:
                ML pipeline is cruicial
                Modularization and versioned(git repository)
                Automation Pipeline

            Here we will learn various tools like:
                1> github
                2> mlflow
                3> jenkins
                4> cloud resources
                5> Cloud computing
                6> Grafana
                7> Chromithius
                8> Contanerization platform

    Once the model Development is complete then proced with 

    iii> ML service deployment:

        1> Integrate with existing application
        2> Create Front end
        3> Containerize the application
        4> API services
        5> Model endpoint

    iv> Continuous Feedback Monitoring:
        1> Track data & Infrastructure
        2> Model
        3> Application Metrics

Introduction to Version Control System:

> Git is an opensource Distributed Version Control System(DVCS).
> A version control system allows you to record changes to files over a period.
> Git is used to maintain the historical and current versions of source code.


Usage at a High level:
-----------------------
> In a project, developres have a copy of all version of the code stored in the central server.
> Git allows developers to do the following:
    * Track the changes, who made the changes and when
    * Rollback/restore changes
    * Allow multiple developers to coordinate the work on the same files.
    * Maintain a copy of the files at the remote and local level.

What is git?
------------
> Git is a technology designed for tracking changes in a project and facilitating collaboration among multiple contributors.
> A Git-contorlled project at its core consists of a folder containing files, with Git monitoring changes made to these files.
> Git's primary function is to enable the storage of vairous versions of project work, earning it the title of version control system.
